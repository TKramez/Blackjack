/*
 * stuff we need to add
 * 
 * -splitting hand works, but we need to make it so the game
 * 	actually runs through the players' multiple hands.
 * -input error checking
 * -make it so when player wallet = 0, game is over.
 * -make it so a player cannot bet more than they have. Also,
 *  check to see if they have enough money to double, split,
 *  or both.
